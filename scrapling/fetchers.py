        Opens up a browser and do your request based on your chosen options below.

        :param url: Target url.
        :param headless: Run the browser in headless/hidden (default), 'virtual' screen mode, or headful/visible mode.
        :param block_images: Prevent the loading of images through Firefox preferences.
            This can help save your proxy usage but be careful with this option as it makes some websites never finish loading.
        :param disable_resources: Drop requests of unnecessary resources for a speed boost. It depends but it made requests ~25% faster in my tests for some websites.
            Requests dropped are of type `font`, `image`, `media`, `beacon`, `object`, `imageset`, `texttrack`, `websocket`, `csp_report`, and `stylesheet`.
            This can help save your proxy usage but be careful with this option as it makes some websites never finish loading.
        :param block_webrtc: Blocks WebRTC entirely.
        :param addons: List of Firefox addons to use. Must be paths to extracted addons.
        :param disable_ads: Disabled by default, this installs `uBlock Origin` addon on the browser if enabled.
        :param humanize: Humanize the cursor movement. Takes either True or the MAX duration in seconds of the cursor movement. The cursor typically takes up to 1.5 seconds to move across the window.
        :param allow_webgl: Enabled by default. Disabling it WebGL not recommended as many WAFs now checks if WebGL is enabled.
        :param geoip: Recommended to use with proxies; Automatically use IP's longitude, latitude, timezone, country, locale, & spoof the WebRTC IP address.
            It will also calculate and spoof the browser's language based on the distribution of language speakers in the target region.
        :param network_idle: Wait for the page until there are no network connections for at least 500 ms.
        :param os_randomize: If enabled, Scrapling will randomize the OS fingerprints used. The default is Scrapling matching the fingerprints with the current OS.
        :param timeout: The timeout in milliseconds that is used in all operations and waits through the page. The default is 30000
        :param page_action: Added for automation. A function that takes the `page` object, does the automation you need, then returns `page` again.
        :param wait_selector: Wait for a specific css selector to be in a specific state.
        :param wait_selector_state: The state to wait for the selector given with `wait_selector`. Default state is `attached`.
        :param google_search: Enabled by default, Scrapling will set the referer header to be as if this request came from a Google search for this website's domain name.
        :param extra_headers: A dictionary of extra headers to add to the request. _The referer set by the `google_search` argument takes priority over the referer set here if used together._
        :param proxy: The proxy to be used with requests, it can be a string or a dictionary with the keys 'server', 'username', and 'password' only.
        :return: A `Response` object that is the same as `Adaptor` object except it has these added attributes: `status`, `reason`, `cookies`, `headers`, and `request_headers`

     Using this Fetcher class, you can do requests with:
        - Vanilla Playwright without any modifications other than the ones you chose.
        - Stealthy Playwright with the stealth mode I wrote for it. It's still a work in progress but it bypasses many online tests like bot.sannysoft.com
            Some of the things stealth mode does include:
                1) Patches the CDP runtime fingerprint.
                2) Mimics some of the real browsers' properties by injecting several JS files and using custom options.
                3) Using custom flags on launch to hide Playwright even more and make it faster.
                4) Generates real browser's headers of the same type and same user OS then append it to the request.
        - Real browsers by passing the `real_chrome` argument or the CDP URL of your browser to be controlled by the Fetcher and most of the options can be enabled on it.
        - NSTBrowser's docker browserless option by passing the CDP URL and enabling `nstbrowser_mode` option.

    > Note that these are the main options with PlayWright but it can be mixed together.
